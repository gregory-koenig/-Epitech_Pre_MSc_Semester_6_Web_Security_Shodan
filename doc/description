 Unit description
Web Security -- SHODAN:

SUBJECTS COVERED: 

Study of vulnerabilities linked to the development of Web applications. 
Non-exhaustive list of domains we will cover:  
Authentification, ACL, configuration, cryptography, encoding, error management, protocols, synchronization, language traps, Web Services, injections.


CLASS OUTLINE: 

There is only one project for this unit: SHODAN.
Throughout the duration of the project, the goal is to succeed in exploiting weaknesses and obtain privileges or information on sites set up for the project.
It's a platform on which groups of students will compete and look to obtain the highest score, sometimes at the cost of other teams.
Before the project, a CFP will take place in order to organize short-talk and workshop sessions that will be lead by students. 


VALIDATION CONDITIONS: 

Skill domains:
- Web pentest environment 
- bruteforce technique, developing simple operations 
- Client security: XSS/CSRF/Phishing
- Various injections: headers HTTP, SQL, URL, code, file, command

General knowledge of the detection and operation of these problems will be a condition to validate this unit.  
Skills to be acquired
Handling Web tools: navigator, proxy, Web Services, command line tools, scripts.
Discovering, understanding and exploiting client and server weaknesses.
Using simple cryptographic tools: x509 certificate, SSL/TLS.
Participating in security-centered events: short-talks/workshops.
